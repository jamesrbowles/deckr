# Deckr App

This is a task app that focuses on priority. As the user adds a task it gets added to the forefront of a deck of previously added tasks.

## Functionality

Each task can be edited, completed or deleted. And the spread button (top left) fans the deck of tasks in a circle with a maximum of 13 tasks. This allows the user to see what other tasks are in the deck and they can be edited, completed or deleted from here as well but when the user clicks out of spread mode the deck is returned to its default stacked placing.

## Key design aspects

- In the default stacked order, the tasks are randomly staggered within a range of movement so as to appear like a real deck of cards. However when in spread mode the tasks have a specific stagger as to follow a circle with the add task button in the middle.

- The top placed card is always the Ace of spades and in reverse order the cards go down to the deuce of spades as the least priority task
